# Vehicle Detection Using Faster R-CNN and DenseNet
### Capstone Project of Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree



 The goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline for detecting vehicle(s) on a road from a video. The video is captured by a forward looking camera mounted on a vehicle.
